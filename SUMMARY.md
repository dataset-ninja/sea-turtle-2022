**Sea Turtle ID 2022 Dataset** is a dataset for instance segmentation, semantic segmentation, object detection, and localization tasks. It is used in the environmental research, and in the fishery industry. 

The dataset consists of 8729 images with 77937 labeled objects belonging to 3 different classes including *turtle*, *flipper*, and *head*.

Images in the Sea Turtle 2022 dataset have pixel-level instance segmentation and bounding box annotations. Due to the nature of the instance segmentation task, it can be automatically transformed into a semantic segmentation task (only one mask for every class). There are 3 (0% of the total) unlabeled images (i.e. without annotations). There are 3 splits in the dataset: *train* (5303 images), *test* (2308 images), and *val* (1118 images). Alternatively, the dataset could be split into 3 closed splits: ***splt closed train*** (4679 images), ***splt closed test*** (2632 images), and ***splt closed val*** (1418 images), or into 3 random closed splits: ***splt closed random train*** (4679 images), ***splt closed random test*** (2632 images), and ***splt closed random val*** (1418 images). Additionally, every image marked with its ***identity***, ***date*** tags. Labels marked with its ***orientation*** and ***occluded***. Explore it in Supervisely labelling tool.
